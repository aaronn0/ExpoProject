Northeastern Cornerstone Of Engineering Final Project

The code does not work without plugging in a pico kit.
If a pico kit is plugged in and it still does not work, check if it is in the correct port by going to Device Manager and comparing its value to the port defined in line 12 of phase_two.py. If they differ, change the port defined in phase_two.py.
